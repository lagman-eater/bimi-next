Therefore, the focus of the course is the term, its structure and meaning. Therefore, knowledge of the Latin language for a physician makes it possible to understand the terminology of other, related sciences. Learning Latin improves the lexical stock of the physician and facilitates the process of memorizing new words of foreign origin. Latin in medicine is traditionally used as the international terminology of anatomy and pharmacology, as well as in the preparation of recipes. Greek and Latin terminological units: denote the basic concepts of medical practice, generally accepted in medical practice; play the role of a system-forming factor in the formation of medical terminology. The Latin language is most directly connected with all disciplines studied at the faculty, especially with anatomy, biology, biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, clinical disciplines. The study of the discipline allows laying the foundations of terminological training of future specialists, teaching students to consciously and competently apply medical terms in Latin when studying medical disciplines, as well as competently use terms of Greek-Latin origin in English and Russian in their practical and scientific activities. Upon completion of the course of study, students develop practical skills that allow them to successfully overcome the terminological difficulties of international Greek-Latin terminology, the ability to use the knowledge gained in the subsequent study of other fundamental and clinical disciplines, as well as in the future professional activity of a doctor."

Philosophy views the world through the prism of a truly human attitude to it, lays the foundations of a humanistic worldview. It contributes to the self-determination of a person in the world, the constructive solution of the most important meaning-life issues, the development of an effective life strategy. Philosophy develops a general theoretical picture of the relationship between man and the world, reveals the deep foundations of culture. Philosophy together with psychology indicate the ways of mastering the cultural content of the emerging personality, which is necessary for entering an independent life and fruitful self-realization. The study of the discipline allows you to form the scientific foundations of a professional understanding of the subject area of philosophy. In the process of education, it is necessary to arm oneself with philosophical knowledge in order to subsequently be able to independently understand complex philosophical issues and issues of life in general. A certain level of philosophical knowledge will give you the opportunity to think independently and creatively, and also allows you to correctly evaluate various philosophical religious views, to distinguish serious teachings from outright charlatanism. All this involves the development of skills and abilities to apply philosophy as a methodological basis for solving a variety of cognitive, research and practical tasks that future medical specialists will meet in their lives.

The basic biological properties of pathogens, their interaction with the macroorganism and the environment, the mechanisms of protection of the human body are studied. Currently, microorganisms represent by number the most significant and most diverse part of the organisms inhabiting the Earth's biosphere. This served as the basis for the division of all microorganisms into 4 large kingdoms: bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. Each of them is the object of study of separate sections of microbiology, independent disciplines — bacteriology, mycology, protozoology and virology. During the development of microbiology, original research methods were developed, many borrowed from other disciplines — biophysics, biochemistry, genetics, cytology, etc. The task of studying 'Microbiology, virology and immunology' is to master theoretical knowledge and practical skills that provide indication and identification of bacteria, viruses and other pathogenic microbes, serological diagnosis of major infectious diseases, as well as methods for isolating and detecting pathogens in the external environment."

The main task of propaedeutics of surgical diseases is to teach methods of patient research, recognition of leading clinical syndromes, construction of a syndromic diagnosis, as well as teaching the basics of medical ethics and deontology. For the successful treatment of any disease, especially a disease that requires surgical treatment, accurate and timely recognition of it is of great importance. Examination of surgical patients, along with general principles, has its own characteristics. These features are due to the nature of a significant part of surgical diseases - their transience and the development of formidable complications, which in many cases requires rapid diagnosis and implementation of medical measures in an emergency or urgent manner. The ability to recognize the symptoms of diseases, to know the basic modern diagnostic methods, to master the methodology of diagnosis, will help the student in the future to master the chosen specialty and apply the knowledge in practical work.

The range of diseases of internal organs included in the academic program of hospital therapy has been expanded due to relatively rare diseases. To form clinical thinking (the ability to make a detailed clinical diagnosis based on the collected information about the patient); to teach the basic principles of prevention and treatment of diseases of internal organs. Students study the patterns of development and formation of therapeutic diseases, the mechanisms of the principles of progression, knowledge of pathogenetic justified treatment and prevention. By the end of the course, students can choose the necessary examination methods that are justified in a particular case, on the basis of which to make a clinical diagnosis, prescribe adequate treatment depending on age and gender differences. Demonstrate the skills of determining the disease, etiology, risk factors (FR), pathogenesis, pathomorphology, classification, clinical picture, laboratory and instrumental diagnostics, principles of treatment, primary and secondary prevention, prognosis for variants of the most common diseases of internal organs, their features and complications.

The range of diseases of internal organs included in the academic program of hospital therapy has been expanded due to relatively rare diseases. To form clinical thinking (the ability to make a detailed clinical diagnosis based on the collected information about the patient); to teach the basic principles of prevention and treatment of diseases of internal organs. Students study the patterns of development and formation of therapeutic diseases, the mechanisms of progression, knowledge of pathogenetically sound methods of treatment and prevention. By the end of the course, students can choose the necessary examination methods that are justified in a particular case, on the basis of which to make a clinical diagnosis, prescribe adequate treatment depending on age and gender differences. Demonstrate the skills of determining the disease, etiology, risk factors (FR), pathogenesis, pathomorphism, classification, clinical picture, laboratory and instrumental diagnostics, principles of treatment, primary and secondary prevention, prognosis for variants of the most common diseases of internal organs, their features and complications. Recognize the clinical manifestations of some urgent conditions, carry out a detailed condition, emergency diagnosis and have the skills to provide emergency medical care, including diagnosing and providing emergency care to children and adults at the pre-hospital and hospital stages."

      "Title": "Harm Reduction Concept",
      "Text1": "The Harm Reduction Concept (HRC) is a growing approach in developed countries to combat non-communicable diseases caused by harmful habits. HRC takes into account the dependence of individuals on smoking, alcohol, salt, sugar, and high-calorie foods. The concept proposes the use of 'soft power', where instead of prohibiting harmful products, the right to choose is offered by replacing the harmful product with a scientifically backed, less harmful alternative. In this way, HRC effectively complements traditional measures to combat non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and achieves the overall goals of public health.",
      "Text2": "'Harm reduction' (Eng. harm reduction) is an approach aimed at preserving the health of each member of human society, focused not on banning harmful health behaviors, but on reducing harmful consequences and changing behavior towards safer practices. The term 'harm reduction' emerged about 25 years ago to describe strategies and programs aimed at reducing the 'negative medical, social, and economic consequences of substance use for drug users, their families, and society as a whole'. According to public health experts, the priority of the harm reduction strategy is 'preventing HIV and other infections transmitted through injectable drug use, as well as overdoses, involvement in criminal activities, the breakdown of family and social ties, and other medical and social consequences. Based on this, harm reduction implies a set of medical and preventive measures that 'aim to prevent the transmission of HIV and other infections through the sharing of non-sterile injection equipment and drug solutions.' There are different definitions of 'harm reduction' that encompass different aspects of theory and practice, accepted by various experts and activists. However, the basic principles of this strategy are not in doubt among harm reduction supporters. WHO research has shown that human health depends on the healthcare system only by 8-10%. The determining factors are entirely different. Specifically, 20% of our health and physical condition is determined by the environment, another 20% by genetic factors, and 50-52% by lifestyle. The numbers speak for themselves. It might seem simple: change your lifestyle, eat properly, quit harmful habits, move more, and enjoy good health! However, in practice, it's not so simple. The problem is that behind harmful habits, which a person cannot abandon, lies dependence. And it doesn't necessarily have to be drug dependence, like nicotine addiction. It could be, for instance, a psychological dependence on fatty food. Or a habit of consuming large amounts of sugar daily because we believe it boosts our mood. Often, we are unable to overcome this dependence. And often – we simply don't want to, downplaying the significance of the problem or not even realizing why we need this.' – Alfiya Samigullina"
